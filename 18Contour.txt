Edges = boundary pixels
Contours = connected boundary pixels (shapes)curve or outlines or object boundaries

The pixels that have strong intensity change are usually right next to each other.
So when Canny marks those pixels as white (255):
they appear like a line and seem connected but in actual its not the case
Contour will FIND groups of pixels that are already connected.
