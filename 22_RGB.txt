converting an RGB image → BGR does NOT change how the picture looks in cv.imshow()

Pipeline:
Camera image: RGB  
↓  
cv.imread(): Converts to BGR  
↓  
cv.imshow(): expects BGR by design, so it displays the BGR image with correct colors (red looks red, blue looks blue)
↓  
You see correct colors  



What happens when you convert BGR → RGB yourself?

rgb = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
cv.imshow("wrong", rgb)

But cv.imshow always expects BGR, so when it receives an RGB image:
It interprets RGB as BGR ([255, 0, 0] (Red) interpreted as [255, 0, 0] (Blue) )
So the Red channel becomes Blue
The Blue channel becomes Red
